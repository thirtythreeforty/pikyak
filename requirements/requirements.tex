\section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The purpose of this Requirements Document is to specify the software requirements of PikYak, an anonymous picture sharing social media platform.
        The document will help to define the concept and functionality of PikYak for development.

    \subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}
        The following terms are used throughout the document.

        \begin{description*}
            \item[post:] A message, containing only a single picture, submitted to the public PikYak server for other users to view.

            \item[up-vote:] A single positive vote that users can give to a post to signify that they enjoy the content.

            \item[down-vote:] A single negative vote that users can give to a post to signify that they do not enjoy the content.

            \item[score:] The value of the sum of a post's downvotes subtracted from the sum of its upvotes.
                          This measure provides a rough indication of how popular a post is.

            \item[conversation:] A grouping of posts that are made in reply to one another.
                                 Creating a new post either creates a new conversation or replies to an existing one.

            \item[user:] A person who interacts with the PikYak service.

                         PikYak has three classes of users:

                         \begin{description*}
                             \item[unregistered user:] Can view posts on the PikYak network using the client app.
                             \item[registered user:] Can perform all actions that an unregistered user can, and can also create new posts and conversations and up- and down-vote existing ones.
                             \item[moderator:] Can perform all actions that a registered user can, and can also remove inappropriate or junk posts.  This user class will typically be affiliated with PikYak.
                         \end{description*}

                         Unless otherwise specified, in this document, the term ``user'' will refer to a registered user.
        \end{description*}

\section{System Overview}
    \subsection{Purpose}
        PikYak will be an anonymous picture sharing application that allows users to exchange images with other users that are local to each other.  The application will allow users to comment, upvote, and downvote images.

        Conversations will by default be ranked according to their proximity to the user's location and to their crowd-determined score.  The application will alert users to activity in conversations they have participated in.

        Moderators will have the opportunity to review unpopular posts and discipline the post's author through appropriate action.

\section{User Interface}
    \subsection{Main Screen}
        The main screen will consist of a scrolling list of recent conversations.
        A mockup is given in Figure~\ref{fig:mainscreen}.
        Each conversation will be represented by a thumbnail of the original post made in that conversation and a small number indicating the number of replies in the conversation.
        The number shall be absent if there have been no replies to the post.
        The list of conversations (and the corresponding reply indicators) will update in real time as other users add new posts.
        Touching a post shall enter the conversation view (see Section~\ref{sec:conversation}) for that post.

        The Android action bar shall contain the following menu items:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Create Conversation}, which shall begin a new conversation according to Section~\ref{sec:post}.
            \item \emph{Sort}, which shall present the user with a menu to sort conversations by score or by the date of the most recent post.
            \item \emph{Refresh}, which shall force the application to update the list of conversations.
            \item \emph{Sign In}, which shall allow the user to register or sign in to the service according to Section~\ref{sec:register}.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{figure}[h]
            \centering \includegraphics[width=6cm,keepaspectratio]{mockups/main}
            \caption{The Android client's main screen}
            \label{fig:mainscreen}
        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Conversation View}
    \label{sec:conversation}
        The conversation view will consist of a scrolling list of the recent posts in a given conversation.
        A mockup is given in Figure~\ref{fig:conversationscreen}.
        The list shall update in real time when another user posts to the conversation.

        Each post will be represented by a cropped version of the image, which the user can touch to view the full image.
        Overlaid on the right of each post will be a small number indicating the post's score, as well as upvote and downvote arrows.
        These arrows shall function according to Sections~\ref{sec:upvote} and~\ref{sec:downvote}.
        There shall also be a Share button overlaid in the lower right hand corner of the image that shall invoke the Android sharing menu for that image.

        A Remove Post button shall appear on each post only for moderators, and only for posts that have been flagged due to low score.  This button shall remove the post from PikYak for all users, replacing it with a ``deleted'' message.

        At the bottom of the page there will be a Reply button which will allow the user to capture an image and post it, as in Section~\ref{sec:post}.

        The Android action bar shall contain the following menu items:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{Subscribe}, which shall subscribe or unsubscribe the user from the conversation according to Section~\ref{sec:subscribe}.
            \item \emph{Remove Conversation}, which shall appear only for a moderator, and only for conversations that have been flagged.  This button shall remove the conversation in its entirety from PikYak, replacing it with a ``deleted'' message.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{figure}[h]
